# intuitive-json-query-language
A simple, human-readable query language implementation for being able to filter for specific JavaScript/JSON objects in an array.

Notes: jsonpathplus supports the original syntax of it but extend it to support nested objects into array using jsonpath which was a lack

## Motivation

My main motivation was to create a JQL-like query language for JSON objects which I can use to define complex criterias for generating smart music playlist from my music library.

My plan was to enable filtering and testing JSON objects (as music metadata) against queries that are able to check for more than one criteria in metadata object.

# Install

```
npm i intuitive-json-query-language
```

# Usage

```
const ijql = require('intuitive-json-query-language');

const musicMetadata = [
    {
        ...
    }
]

// to filter elements of an array for a query
const matchingElements = ijql.filter(
    musicMetaData,
    'artist IS Bruno Mars AND comments INCLUDES favorite'
);

// to check an object against a query (if you might save on iterations)
const isMatching = ijql.testElementAgainstQuery(
    musicMetadatap[0],
    'albumArtist IS Phil Collins AND (comments INCLUDES energic OR comments INCLUDES party)'
);
```

# Methods

## `filter(elements, query)`
Filter those elements from the `elements` array which are matching to the query.

- `elements` is an array of Objects
- `query` is a string containing a query detailed below

*Returns:* an array which is subset of the `elements` array.

## `testElementAgainstQuery(element, query)`
Check complience of the object in `element` with the query.

- `element` object to check against query
- `query` is a string containing a query detailed below

*Returns:* true / false

# Query syntax

## Syntax

### Conditions
```
<propertyPathOnTestedObject> <operator> <lookupValue>
```

- propertyPathOnTestedObject is a string and can describe a deep path on the object
- operator: see below the list of operators
- lookUp value is what we need equality/containment etc.

For example:
```
{
    name: {
        fistName: 'Peter'
    }
}

name.firstName IS Peter
```

### Parens and embedded logical expressions

IJQL supports any levels of logical grouping, like (by shortening conditions into single letter)

```
a OR (b AND (c OR d) AND e) AND f
```

OR is always evaluated later than a same-level AND oeprator.

## Operators

> IMPORTANT: Space is always needed around operators!

- `AND` - logical AND - only true if all operands are true
- `OR` - logical OR - only false if all operands are false
- `NOT INCLUDES` - check if an array or a string NOT contains the look-up value on its right
- `INCLUDES` - check if an array or a string NOT contains the look-up value on its right
- `IS` - check if the value on the property path *strict equals* to the look-up value on its right
- `IS NOT` - check if the value on the property path *not strictly equals* to the look-up value on its right
- `<` - check if the value on the property path is *less than* the given look-up value
- `>` - check if the value on the property path is *greater than* the given look-up value
